# proj6-Gcal
Snarf appointment data from a selection of a user's Google calendars. A flask app that 
asks the user for a desired meeting date range and time range and asks the user to select
the google calendars he/she would like the program to use. Then, the program displays all 
the appointments from the user's selected google calendars that lie within or partially overlap 
the desired time range and are appointments that block time (in iCalendar terms, non-transparent).
